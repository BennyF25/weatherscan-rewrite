# weatherscan-rewritten
Rewritten version of the original [Weatherscan Emulator](https://github.com/buffbears/Weatherscan) in NextJs. (Basically an organized, readable version) Original credits go to [buffbears](https://github.com/buffbears).

## Why?
I made this out of curiousity and it was very interesting to me. (Plus that music as well) I managed to find source code but I could barely read it. I ended up making this project in a more modern sense and deployed it as such.

## Roadmap
- [x] Support for celsius units (Implemented in sidebar)
- [x] Music player controls? (Sort of)
- [ ] Fully working and operational
